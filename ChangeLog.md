## [1.0.6-bf+5] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Survey-record search:** Added search to the record selector when viewing or modifying a survey, making it quicker to find the correct existing record.
- **Checkbox LogicCheck operators:** Logic checks now support `contains` and `does not contain` for checkbox and other multi-select values, allowing validation rules to test whether a selected-value list includes or excludes a specific response.

## [1.0.5-bf+4] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Vaccine coverage participant message:** Fixed the message shown when there are no "Vaccine coverage" participants so it no longer displays the technical filter text `need_vac_cov=1`.
- **French special-response labels:** For Burkina Faso, "Don't know" and "Refuse" now display in French as "Ne sait pas" and "Refuse de répondre".
- **Incomplete decimal validation:** Decimal numeric fields now require a digit after the decimal separator when a decimal is entered. Values such as `120.` are blocked, while whole numbers and completed decimals such as `120`, `120.0`, and `120.5` remain valid.
- **Special-response option layout:** "Don't know" and "Refuse" radio and checkbox options now use the full response width while keeping their distinct highlight colors, preventing awkward text wrapping in longer labels.

## [1.0.4-bf+3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **SFTP survey download hang:** Downloading a survey from the Burkina Faso server could hang indefinitely. An untracked `pubspec.lock` had silently picked up a `dartssh2` release that rewrote the SSH transport's internals; pinned back to the previously known-good `2.18.0`. Also added a 2-minute timeout to the SFTP download as a safety net against future stalls.

### Housekeeping
- **`pubspec.lock` now tracked in git:** A blanket `*.lock` rule in `.gitignore` was unintentionally excluding it, so dependency versions could drift between machines/builds without anyone noticing.
- **Fixed the version-bump tool:** `tool/update_version.dart` crashed on this branch's `-bf` version suffix and, even on plain versions, silently dropped the build number instead of incrementing it.

## [1.0.3-bf+2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Stale answers after skip navigation:** Forward postskip and preskip jumps now clear answers for every bypassed question before processing automatic fields, including chained skip routes. Primary-key and protected fields remain intact.
- **Cleared answers in modified surveys:** Answers cleared by skip logic are now written back to SQLite as `null`, preventing old values from remaining in saved records.

### Changed
- **macOS application icon:** Replaced the default Flutter icon with the GiSTX branding and configured repeatable macOS launcher-icon generation.

## [1.0.2+1] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Special responses for text & combobox questions:** "Don't know" and "Refuse" buttons are now available on `text` and `combobox` questions, matching the existing behaviour for `radio`, `checkbox`, and `date` types. Selecting one records the configured value (e.g. `-7`) and bypasses the field's format, length, mask, and numeric-range validation.

### Fixed
- **Logic checks with negative/decimal values:** Logic-check conditions now accept signed and decimal numeric literals (e.g. `cattle = -7`). Previously these threw an "Invalid condition format" error.
- **Numeric range vs. special responses:** Selecting a special response (e.g. "Don't know") on an integer field that has a min/max range no longer blocks navigation with a range error.

### Changed
- **French localization:** Localized the remaining hardcoded English UI strings to French — combobox/date/date-time placeholders, the special-response button labels ("Ne sait pas" / "Refuse de répondre"), and the questionnaire-selector error messages. Wording follows the selected country.

## [1.0.1+1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Display fields on linked-survey selection:** When selecting a child/sister survey, the parent-record selector now shows the configured `display_fields`, making records easier to identify.
- **Build tooling:** Upgraded Gradle, the Android Gradle Plugin, and Kotlin; removed the deprecated `kotlin-android` plugin.

### Housekeeping
- Stopped tracking the contents of the `tmp/` working folder.

## [1.0.0+1] - 2026-06-12

First stable 1.0 release.

### Added
- **Burkina Faso SFTP support:** Added SFTP transfers via `dartssh2`, with the server and port (2220) selected automatically based on settings, so this build can use the Burkina Faso server.
- **Desktop builds:** Added macOS build support and a macOS/Linux `SharedPreferences` fallback.
- **Release signing:** Release builds are now signed from `key.properties`.

### Changed
- **Full French localization:** Translated all remaining hardcoded English error messages and UI strings to French; English/French wording is selected by country.

### Fixed
- **Upload verification:** FTP/SFTP uploads are now verified before being reported as successful, preventing false "upload succeeded" results.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Linking field preservation in non-base tables:** Fixed issue where automatic linking fields (e.g., `subjid` in followup surveys) were being overwritten with `-9` when viewing/modifying records. The system now properly preserves existing values for automatic fields that have no registry handler and no calculation configuration, ensuring linking fields in non-base tables maintain their correct values from the parent table throughout the edit process.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- **Save retry bug:** The `_isSaving` flag is now reset after the try/catch block completes, regardless of success or failure. This ensures users can retry saving if an error occurs.
- **Database upload mismatch:** The database upload function now correctly uses the database name specified in the `survey_manifest.gistx` file instead of assuming `{surveyId}.sqlite`. This fixes the "Database file not found" error during uploads.
- **Age calculation bug in edit mode:** Fixed critical issue where age calculations using `age_from_date` would recalculate based on today's date instead of the original survey date when editing existing surveys months later, causing incorrect age values.

### Changed
- **Enhanced `age_at_date` calculation:** Now supports field references using double bracket syntax (e.g., `separator='[[startdate]]'`) in addition to hardcoded dates. This allows dynamic date references for age calculations.
- **Deprecated `age_from_date`:** The `age_from_date` calculation type is now deprecated in favor of `age_at_date` with `separator='[[startdate]]'` for clearer, more explicit date referencing. Existing surveys using `age_from_date` will continue to work with a deprecation warning and will automatically use `startdate` as the reference date for backward compatibility.

### Documentation
- Updated `AGE_CALCULATION_GUIDE.md` with new field reference syntax and migration instructions from deprecated `age_from_date` to `age_at_date`.


## [0.0.8] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Data persistence in skipped questions:** Implemented real-time clearing of answers when skip logic bypasses previously answered questions
  - Added `_clearAnswersInRange()` method to clear data for questions in range being jumped over during forward navigation
  - Modified `_next()` method to detect skip logic jumps and automatically clear affected fields
  - Prevents incorrect data from appearing on information screens and being saved to database
  - Complements existing save-time cleanup with proactive navigation-time clearing



### [0.0.7] - 2025-12-30
* Added 'startdate' automatic field type
* Added `date_offset` calculation type to calculate date-diff between two dates
* Added optional regex formatting (input masking) for text fileds
* Changed the exit prompt when modifying a survey to: "Are you sure you want to cancel. All edits/modifications will be lost!"
* Implemented cascading clear logic for dependent fields so that changing a 'parent' field clears 'child' fields
* Implemented a "Review Changes" system for survey modifications that generates a logical summary replacing technical IDs with human-readable labels and expanding placeholders like `[[participantsname]]`.
* Integrated numeric-aware logic into the summary system to highlight genuine data changes while ignoring benign differences like numeric padding.
* Added three options to the review dialog: Save Changes, Back to Edit, or Discard & Exit, with a secondary confirmation for the discard option.
