- add skips - this will change the Next/Prev functionality
- auto-advance automatic questions
- add some sort of database - ensure radio saves the number and checkboxes save a list of numbers
- add logic checks
- cannot move forward until a question is answered
- validation per question
- review screen before Finish - this may be too long
- implement range checks
- add 'modifying survey' - change auto variables
- after finishing survey, it should go to another screen and ask if i want to do another survey - maybe a new/modify option
- interview_id is a GGUID - it can be an auto-increment stareting at 1
