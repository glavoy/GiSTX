### To Do

- add logic checks
- cannot move forward until a question is answered
- validation per question
- review screen before Finish - this may be too long
- implement range checks
- add 'modifying survey' - change auto variables
- after finishing survey, it should go to another screen and ask if i want to do another survey - maybe a new/modify option
- interview_id is a GGUID - it can be an auto-increment stareting at 1
- do not shoiw automatic variables - this will change the logic of next/previous question numbers
- have date ranges: +/- day(s)/month(s)/year(s) - gist config
- radio buttons should move forward as soon as one is selected
- when opening a new question, the focus should be on the response area for text
- ensure skip logic works for several skips at once
